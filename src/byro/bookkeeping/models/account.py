        # This query is a bit complex:
        #
        # 1. We rely on the fact, that a transaction can only have either
        #    multiple debit bookings or multiple credit bookings but not both.
        #    This is a general nececity for the database scheme to have
        #    unambigious cash flow.
        #
        # 2. First, we select all transactions and join the coresponding bookings,
        #    so we get something like this:
        #
        #     transaction_id  | debit_account_id | credit_account_id | amount
        #    -----------------+------------------+-------------------+--------
        #                  1  |               10 |                15 | 100.00
        #                  1  |               12 |                15 |  20.00
        #                  2  |             .... |               ... |    ...
        #
        #    Note: Even through transaction 1 corresponds to a single credit
        #    booking row of 120.00 â‚¬ for account 15 in the database, this credit
        #    booking is splitted here into two rows. These credit parts are then
        #    joined with the debit bookings, so every row corresponds to one
        #    "cash flow" from credit_account_id to debit_account_id. This
        #    happens for all split transactions in both directions (splitted
        #    debits and splitted credits).
        #
        # 3. To obtain the correct amount for the cash flow, the lower amount of
        #    both sides (debit and credit) is taken. This works under the
        #    premise 1.
        #
        # 4. To filter for cash flows which include a certain account
        #    only_consider_account_id, the WHERE clause
        #    "(%s in (C.credit_account_id, D.debit_account_id) OR %s)" is
        #    introduced. The second variable %s is used to bypass the first
        #    clause if all all accounts should be considered. This case
        #    is associated with only_consider_account_id = None.
        #
        # 5. As we do not want to include unbalanced transactions, there is
        #    another part in the where clause, which makes sure, that both
        #    credit_account_id and dedit_account_id are not NULL for all
        #    selected rows.
        #
        # 6. As we are only interested in the accumulated cash flows, the
        #    GROUP BY statement merges the transactions per (debit, credit)
        #    account pair. This result is made available as CTE to the accounts
        #    query via the name "cash_flows".
        #
        # 7. The actual select statement for the accounts uses subqueries to
        #    the CTE result to obtain the balances.
