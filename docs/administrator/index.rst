Administrator documentation
===========================

byro is free software, which means you can run it yourself on your own server
(or your own Raspberry Pi, â€¦). But while this offers you great freedom, it also
comes with great responsibility:

.. warning:: Hosting byro means taking responsibility for your members' personal and financial data. Please make sure that your installation and servers are secure and will be maintained in the future. If you don't feel comfortable with this, consider contacting us for information, or choosing an offline installation.

The following pages document a uncomplicated setup without going into details
on administrative basics like securing your server, or performing backups.
